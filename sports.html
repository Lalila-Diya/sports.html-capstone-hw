    <h1>Sports</h1>
    <p>Sports are essential activities that promote physical and mental well-being, teaching valuable skills like teamwork,
    discipline, and leadership. Engaging in sports can improve overall health by strengthening the heart and lungs,
    controlling weight, and building strong bones. Beyond physical benefits, sports foster a sense of community, build
    confidence, and provide a healthy outlet for enjoyment and social connection.</p>

The objective is for two teams of five players to score points by shooting a ball through the opponent's 10-foot-high hoop. Teams move the ball down the court by passing or dribbling and work together on both offense and defense. The game demands and develops a variety of athletic skills, including shooting, running, jumping, and hand-eye coordination.

            style="float:right ; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px"> Badminton is a fast-paced racket sport played by two opposing players (singles) or two pairs (doubles) on a rectangular
            court divided by a net. Players use rackets to hit a shuttlecock, or "birdie," over the net, aiming to land it within
            the opponent's side of the court. Because the shuttlecock is lightweight and easily affected by wind, competitive
            matches are typically playedindoors.

            style="float:left ; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px"> Tennis is a globally popular racket sport played by either two players (singles) or two teams of two players (doubles)
            on a rectangular court divided by a net. Using a strung racket, players strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt,
            aiming to hit it over the net and into the opponent's court in a way that prevents a legal return. The modern game,
            originally called "lawn tennis," developed in 19th-century England, though its roots trace back to a 12th-century French
            handball game.

            style="float:right ; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px"> Polo is a fast-paced team sport played on horseback, where two teams of four players use long-handled mallets to hit a
            small ball through the opponent's goal. With origins in ancient Persia as a cavalry training exercise, it spread across
            Asia and Europe, becoming known as "the sport of kings" due to its association with aristocracy and royalty. Today, the
            modern game is played in a regulated format with specific positions and rules, though variations like the unique Ladakhi
            version that includes cultural festivities also exist.

            style="float:left ; margin-right:10px; margin-bottom:10px"> Ice hockey is a fast-paced, team sport played on ice where two teams of six players compete to score goals by shooting a
            puck into the opponent's net. Players use hockey sticks and wear ice skates to move at high speeds across the rink, and
            the game is known for its physical contact. Winning requires speed, strategy, and teamwork, and penalties are issued
            when rules are broken, forcing the offending player to a penalty box.
